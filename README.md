### FERN Stack
This repository contains code written by me as I try and venture from my usual MERN Stack into FERN stack that uses Google's Firebase as the NOSQL database.

## Process.
Thus are the commits I have made to this repository:

1. Initial commit
    * Create a README.md file

2. Install React and Firebase.
    * Create the backend and frontend folders
    * npx create-react-app frontend.
    * Clean up of the frontend folder.
    * npm install firebase react-bootstrap react-router-dom --save
